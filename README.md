## 📊 Quick Reference

### Essential NumPy Functions
```python
# Array Creation
np.array([1, 2, 3])          # Create array from list
np.arange(0, 10, 2)          # Range with step
np.linspace(0, 1, 5)         # Evenly spaced values
np.zeros((3, 4))             # Zero-filled array
np.ones((2, 3))              # One-filled array
np.eye(3)                    # Identity matrix

# Array Operations
arr.shape                    # Array dimensions
arr.reshape(2, -1)           # Reshape array
arr.sum(axis=0)              # Sum along axis
arr @ arr2                   # Matrix multiplication
arr[arr > 5]                 # Boolean indexing
```
